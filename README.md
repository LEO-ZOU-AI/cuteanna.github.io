I have a crush on you.
You know guys. When I first saw this girl, I totally flipped. I made this web, aiming to discribe the sence that the first time we watch fireworks on beach. I scared a lot because I was going to be subtle and tell her I like you. 
I've made up an old Chinese poem, and I'm going to use a dead branch to express my feelings when the fireworks are in full bloom.
So when you click on leo you will see the dead branch that I held up to the fireworks and the words that I uttered, "My branches have grown wild for a thousand years just for your eyes to be full of stars at this moment. Whatever desolation you gaze upon blooms as a miracle in my life. " Eventhough she might never login github to check README out, I am also glad I could write it down and share it to you who is watching this story.
I don't kown the ending what gonna happen between us, but the story have already happened between you and me. 
Good morning, Good evening, and Good night :)
